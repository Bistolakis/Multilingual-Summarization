# Multilingual Abstractive Text Summarization

Natural language processing has grown a lot in the modern age of Big Data. One of the major
goals of the scientific community is the creation of abstract summaries from machines.
This goal also includes the creation of models that will be capable of producing summaries
in multiple languages. This thesis uses multilingual models such as mT5 to generate abstract
summaries using related languages during fine-tuning. In particular, it seems that models
like these can generalize their ability to summarize in many languages, even if they have few
samples in fine-tuning. The use of related languages seems to help individual languages with
improved quality in summaries compared to models witch are trained with one language
data. Also, this method seems to be a good alternative when there is not enough amount
of data from a language, since the ability to summarize seems to be transferred more easily
from one language to another when these are related. Overall research shows that using
related languages to train multilingual models is more efficient, because in less training time
the summaries are improved compared to models which where trained in each language
separately. As a conclusion, it is preferable by the scientific community to use multilingual
models since they are more efficient and useful as well.
## Model
MT5 is an extension of the T5 encoder decoder model, in particular it is a multilingual model trained in 101 languages in the new mC4 dataset by Common Crawl corpus. The new version is considerably larger, increasing both the dimension of embendings and linear layers in the model, with the smaller model containing 300 million parameters. In pre-training it does not contain supervised methods such as T5, only it is trained with Span language Modeling and therefore needs to be further trained before it is used in natural language processing. For the production of the dictionary, The Sentence Peice was used and the number of tokens of the dictionary is 250,000. The hyperparameters in the pre-training are the same as in the T5 model. MT5 uses relative distances to encode the positions of words. This means that the size of the input is not strictly defined, unlike mBart which
it is used for the same dataset, with input to 1024 tokens. A larger size is used here, the input of the model is set at 1100 tokens, while the output at 140. With this filter, tokens are removed from the input to 16% of the
texts. It is worth mentioning that the average in tokens is 612 for the input and
42 for the output.

## DATA Selection 
The data comes from the Wikilingua dataset, which it is presented in 2020. WikiLingua is a set of parallel text-summary pairs
translated into 18 languages. In addition
it is a fairly qualitative set, as the summaries and translations come from
from the WIkiHow page that have been created and studied by groups of columnists something very important and especially in the
abstract summarization. The languages that will be combined during training are a) German, Dutch and English, B)
Italian and Spanish. The first three languages were chosen as they belong to
in the West Germanic family and is in the three most spoken West Germanic languages. The first most spoken language is English, then German and Dutch. German has a lexical similarity to Dutch which close to
80%, while with English the similarity of words is 60%. Spanish and
Italian was chosen because they belong to the family of Latin languages and have
lexical similarity 82%.

## Results
In this section will be presented only the Italian - Spanish language models.

Exploring the similarity of Italian-Spanish, three models are trained, an Italian model with 40 thousand data, a Spanish model with 80 thousand data and a Spanish-Italian model with a total of 80 thousand data, in this case only half of Spanish data is used. With this, Spanish is tested with less data and all models are compared in the same training steps.

As shown in the Italian test table, the Italian-Spanish model has been trained once in Italian data and achieves better metrics in summary than the Italian_Tho_EP model which requires the same training time.
